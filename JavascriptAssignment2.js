### 1. Introduction to JavaScript Fundamentals (Variable, Let, const)

**Exercise 1**:
- Declare a variable using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Try reassigning values to each variable. Note down the results and explain why.

**Exercise 2**:
- Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in terms of scope and reassignment.

### 2. Variables and Data Types

**Exercise 1**:
- Declare variables of different data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, and array.

**Exercise 2**:
- Use `typeof` to check the data type of each variable.

### 3. Operators and Expressions

**Exercise 1**:
- Perform arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) on two numbers and print the results.

**Exercise 2**:
- Use comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) to compare two values and print the results.

### 4. Control Structures

**Exercise 1**:
- Write a function that takes a number as input and prints whether it is even or odd using if-else statements.

**Exercise 2**:
- Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

### 5. Functions and Scope

**Exercise 1**:
- Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.

**Exercise 2**:
- Demonstrate the difference between local and global scope by creating variables inside and outside a function.

### 6. Objects and Arrays

**Exercise 1**:
- Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and pages. Access and print each property.

**Exercise 2**:
- Create an array of numbers and find the sum of all elements using a loop.

### 7. Template Literals

**Exercise**:
- Create a string using template literals that includes variables and expressions.

### 8. Destructuring Assignment

**Exercise**:
- Use destructuring to extract values from an object and an array.

### 9. Spread and Rest Operators

**Exercise 1**:
- Use the spread operator to combine two arrays into one.

**Exercise 2**:
- Use the rest operator to write a function that accepts any number of arguments and returns their sum.

### 10. Async/Await

**Exercise**:
- Write an async function that fetches data from a public API and logs the response.

### 11. Event Handling

**Exercise**:
- Add an event listener to a button that logs a message when clicked.



### 13. ES6 and Beyond

**Exercise**:
- Use ES6 features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring to write a function that creates a greeting message.

### 14. Arrow Functions

**Exercise**:
- Convert a regular function to an arrow function.
